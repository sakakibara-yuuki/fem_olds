1.6 … and what Gmsh is not so good at
Here are some known weaknesses of Gmsh:


 Gmsh is not a multi-bloc mesh generator: all meshes produced by Gmsh are
conforming in the sense of finite element meshes;
 Gmsh’s graphical user interface is only exposing a limited number of the
available features, and many aspects of the interface could be enhanced
(especially manipulators).
 Your complaints about Gmsh here :-)

If you have the skills and some free time, feel free to join the
project: we gladly accept any code contributions (see Information for developers) to remedy the aforementioned (and all other) shortcomings!
