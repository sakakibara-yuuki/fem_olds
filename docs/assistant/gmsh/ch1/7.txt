1.7 Installing and running Gmsh on your computer


Gmsh can be used either as a standalone application, or as a library.

As a standalone application, Gmsh can be controlled with the GUI
(see Gmsh graphical user interface), through the command line
(see Gmsh command-line interface) and through .geo script
files (see Gmsh scripting language). In addition, the ONELAB
interface (see Solver module) allows to interact with the Gmsh
application through Unix or TCP/IP sockets.  Binary versions of the Gmsh
app for Windows, Linux and macOS can be downloaded from
https://gmsh.info/#Download. Several Linux distributions also ship
the Gmsh app. See Compiling the source code for instructions on
how to compile the Gmsh app from source.

As a library, Gmsh can still be used in the same way as the standalone
Gmsh app, but in addition it can also be embedded in external codes
using the Gmsh API (see Gmsh application programming interface).
The API is available in C++, C, Python, Julia and Fortran.  A binary
Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows, Linux and macOS, that
contains the dynamic Gmsh library and the associated header and module
files, can be downloaded from https://gmsh.info/#Download. Python
users can use

pip install --upgrade gmsh

which will download the binary SDK and install the files in the
appropriate system directories. Several Linux distributions also ship
the Gmsh SDK. See Compiling the source code for instructions on
how to compile the dynamic Gmsh library from source.
