1 Overview of Gmsh


Gmsh is a three-dimensional finite element mesh generator with a
build-in CAD engine and post-processor. Its design goal is to provide a
fast, light and user-friendly meshing tool with parametric input and
flexible visualization capabilities.

Gmsh is built around four modules (geometry, mesh, solver and
post-processing), which can be controlled with the graphical user
interface (GUI; see Gmsh graphical user interface), from the
command line (see Gmsh command-line interface), using text files
written in Gmsh’s own scripting language (.geo files; see
Gmsh scripting language), or through the C++, C, Python, Julia and
Fortran application programming interface (API; see Gmsh application programming interface).

A brief description of the four modules is given hereafter, before an
overview of what Gmsh does best (... and what it is not so good at), and
some practical information on how to install and run Gmsh on your
computer.
